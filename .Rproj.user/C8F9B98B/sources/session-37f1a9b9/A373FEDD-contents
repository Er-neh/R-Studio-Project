#  Birmingham has a rich industrial heritage, earning it the nickname "City of a Thousand Trades" and a significant role in the British Industrial Revolution. It underwent a significant transformation during the 18th and 19th centuries when it evolved from a small market town to a major industrial centre. This transformation provides valuable insights for studying the urban heat island effect (Bassett et al., 2016). Today, the city is experiencing a revival with a thriving services sector and a focus on innovation. Visitors can enjoy Birmingham's lively cultural scene, which includes world-class museums such as the Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery and Symphony Hall, a renowned concert venue. Furthermore, the city's canal network, a testament to its industrial past, has been transformed into a leisure destination that offers scenic boat trips and attractive walkways (Cocks, 2023). Due to rapid urbanization, the city's landscape was significantly altered, replacing natural surfaces with buildings and pavements. This historical context allows us to analyse how such drastic changes in land use can influence local climate patterns.




## Popoulation Density

  Being the second most populous city in the UK, understanding weather patterns in Birmingham can aid in better urban planning, resource allocation, and public safety measures given its impact on a significant number of people. Understanding the weather patterns in Birmingham can provide valuable insights into how the city can be better planned and developed to meet the changing needs of its residents.





## Problem Statement

  Climate change is making heatwaves more frequent, which can have a negative impact on people's health, particularly for Birmingham's most vulnerable groups: the elderly, small children, and people with underlying medical illnesses. To mitigate this, can the available weather data be analysed to identify key factors associated with the heatwave event(s) that occur during the month of May.





## Stakeholders

  When conducting weather data analysis, several key stakeholders stand to benefit from the information learned. Here's a breakdown of some of the most prominent ones:

1.) Residents: The findings of the weather data analysis can empower residents to make informed choices about their daily lives. Knowing about upcoming weather conditions allows them to plan their activities accordingly, choose appropriate clothing, and take steps to minimize energy consumption at home. Moreover, weather data analysis is essential for residents in terms of safety and preparedness. Severe weather events such as storms, heatwaves, or floods can pose significant risks to residents' well-being and property. Timely and accurate forecasts enable residents to take proactive measures to mitigate these risks, such as securing their homes, evacuating flood-prone areas, or seeking shelter during extreme weather events.

2.) Environmental Agencies: Analysing precipitation patterns and soil moisture data can be useful for environmental agencies monitoring water resources and potential droughts. Understanding Birmingham's climate and its relationship with air pollution can inform strategies for improving air quality.

3.) Business Owners: Businesses can use weather data analysis to improve their operations. For instance, construction companies might adjust their schedules based on weather forecasts to avoid delays caused by rain or extreme temperatures. Retail businesses can tailor their inventory based on anticipated weather conditions.
