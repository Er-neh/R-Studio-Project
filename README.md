# R-Studio-Project
Analysing Birmingham's climate through Time series analysis and Machine Learning 

In this project, we will provide a thorough analysis of weather data for Birmingham, a city in the United Kingdom, focusing on various meteorological parameters recorded over a one-month period. 


The dataset used is the  WRF dataset  generated by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, a numerical weather prediction (NWP) system used for both meteorological research and weather forecasting. It contains detailed meteorological data with loacations from around the world for that specific month, with many variables crucial for studying weather patterns, climate trends, and environmental conditions during that time.

Birmingham has a rich industrial heritage, earning it the nickname "City of a Thousand Trades" and a significant role in the British Industrial Revolution. It underwent a significant transformation during the 18th and 19th centuries when it evolved from a small market town to a major industrial centre. This transformation provides valuable insights for studying the urban heat island effect. Due to rapid urbanization, the city's landscape was significantly altered, replacing natural surfaces with buildings and pavements. This historical context allows us to analyse how such drastic changes in land use can influence local climate patterns. 
 Climate change is making heatwaves more frequent, which can have a negative impact on people's health, particularly for Birmingham's most vulnerable groups: the elderly, small children, and people with underlying medical illnesses. To mitigate this, can the available weather data be analysed to identify key factors associated with the heatwave event(s) that occur during the month of May, 2018.
